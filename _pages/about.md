Hello, my name is Hannah Lexer and this is my github website which is being hosted on the Github pages and using the template by [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). On this website, you will be able to learn a little bit about my experience so far to date. Right now, I do not have any projects completed indepently that could be posted on the website, but hopefully in the future I will be able to create a page to show my previous programming projects. Enjoy, and I hope you read more to learn a little bit about me!
